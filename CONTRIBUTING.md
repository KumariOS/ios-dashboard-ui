To run our tests, you'll need to first [install carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage), and then run `carthage update`. We use [FBSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) for snapshot tests. Please make sure existing tests pass, and if possible, write some tests of your own.

Thanks for contributing!
