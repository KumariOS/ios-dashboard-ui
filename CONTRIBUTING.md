To run tests, first install Carthage and download our dependencies.
  - `brew install carthage`
  - `./scripts/install_dependencies.sh`

We use [FBSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) for snapshot tests. You'll need to run tests on an iPhone 6s simulator for snapshot tests to pass. Please make sure existing tests pass, and if possible, write some tests of your own.

Thanks for contributing!
